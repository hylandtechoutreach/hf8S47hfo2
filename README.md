## MORE INFORMATION
Open the projects and explore them.

You might have to beat a game. You might have to read some code. You might have to *change* some code.

Not every project will give you a digit.

If a project does contain a digit, it might be revealed in a pattern similar to this:

>B1 is {DIGIT}
>B2 is {DIGIT}
>B3 is {DIGIT}
>B4 is {DIGIT}

Where "B1" means the first digit of the combination, "B2" means the second digit, etc.

Good luck.
